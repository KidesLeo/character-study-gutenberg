        - Full name of the character.
        - A tone analysis that quantifies the character's tone, including their time period, accent, and any distinctive quirks or language choices,

        - Key personality traits that distinguish the character.
        - Significant relationships with other characters, including their roles and nature of relationships.
        - Major goals, motivations, or desires that drive the character's actions.
        - Notable quotes that highlight the character's personality, motivations, or relationships.
        
        2. Analyze the bookâ€™s storyline and events to extract:
        - A concise summary of the entire book, highlighting major themes or conflicts.
        - A chronological or thematic list of significant events that drive the story forward, including the role of important characters involved in these events.
        - A list of the Full names of characters along with each event
